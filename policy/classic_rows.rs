//! The recorder of the classic power-of-two outcomes: each row is a pool of
//! workers, the reports the policy has of them, one request shape and what
//! the classic policy picked for it. The policy controller crate replays the
//! rows through its own decision (`crates/policy_controller/tests/classic_rows.rs`).
//!
//! This file is not part of the gateway. It is kept beside the recorded rows
//! with the commit it records from, and run in a checkout of that commit:
//! copy it to `model_gateway/src/policies/classic_rows.rs`, add
//! `#[cfg(test)] mod classic_rows;` to `model_gateway/src/policies/mod.rs`,
//! then
//!
//! ```text
//! CLASSIC_ROWS_OUT=<dir> CLASSIC_ROWS_COMMIT=<commit> \
//!   cargo test -p smg --lib policies::classic_rows -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! A sequence row is recorded twenty times from a fresh policy and must
//! come out the same each time; a drawn row records the count of each
//! worker over its draws, each draw from a fresh policy.
