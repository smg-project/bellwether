//! The recorder of the classic manual policy's outcomes: each row is a pool
//! of workers, what the router holds of them (the requests in flight, the
//! routing keys with a request in flight), the policy's assignment mode, a
//! list of steps and what the classic policy picked at each request. The
//! policy controller crate replays the rows through its own decision
//! (`crates/policy_controller/tests/classic/manual.rs`).
//!
//! This file is not part of the gateway. It is kept beside the recorded rows
//! with the commit it records from, and run in a checkout of that commit:
//! copy it to `model_gateway/src/policies/classic_manual_rows.rs`, add
//! `#[cfg(test)] mod classic_manual_rows;` to
//! `model_gateway/src/policies/mod.rs`, then
//!
//! ```text
//! CLASSIC_ROWS_OUT=<dir> CLASSIC_ROWS_COMMIT=<commit> \
//!   cargo test -p smg --lib policies::classic_manual_rows -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! A sequence row is recorded twenty times from a fresh policy and must
//! come out the same each time; a drawn row records how often each worker
//! took the row's last request over its draws, each draw from a fresh
//! policy.
